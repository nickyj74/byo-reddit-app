  <h2>Wireframes <br/></h2>
    <p>
      - The app has been designed to work in all modern browsers and any device, from desktop to mobile.<br />
      - There is a simple URL which allows users to access the application.<br />
      - When items are selected the user will be able to see a detailed view on a new page.  <br />

  <h2>Features <br/></h2>
    <p>
      - When first visiting there will be an initial view of the chosen search parameter (Popular). Users can amend the search data to search for a feed based on their own preferences.<br />
      - If users encounter an error state, there will be a message logged to the browser to show that there is an error, and they are then able to search a different term and move on from this error state.  Any errors are also logged to the console.

# STILL TO WRITE 
 - Unit tests for components using Jest and Enzyme will appear throughout the application and an end-to end test will complete this area. 
 - Data can be filtered based on predefined categories.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
